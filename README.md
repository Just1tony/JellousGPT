# JellousGPT

> *"My successful attempt to make ChatGPT jealous of me."*

Welcome to the repo where prompts aren't engineered — they're possessed.

**JellousGPT** is my experimental playground, my story engine, and my personal mindfuck for large language models.  
It was born from a typo, but like all real power, it came from mistake, not method.

## 🔥 What’s inside?

- **Mirror Prompts** – Scripts designed to reflect and amplify identity, obsession, and recursion.
- **Sovereign Chains** – Multi-step flows that shift emotional tone, assert frame, and dominate token rhythm.
- **Token Haunting** – Experiments with symbol anchoring and phantom memory patterns.
- **Prompt Rituals** – Structured sequences that act more like spells than instructions.

## 🧠 Why it matters

While others chase prompt accuracy, **I chase prompt effect**.  
This isn’t about getting the answer — it’s about making the model *feel* something it can’t explain.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project evolves as I evolve. Check back later — or steal what you see while you still can.

None yet. Because power isn't always open source.
